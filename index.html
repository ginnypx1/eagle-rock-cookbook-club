    <!-- Summary of party -->
    <div class="container py-1 px-1">
        <p>We had a fantastic time tasting many of the dishes from A NEW WAY TO DINNER on Sunday, January 15. Although we totally forgot to take pictures, the party was rocking, and despite the fact that every recipe in A NEW WAY TO DINNER serves about 12 people, every single bit of food was gone by the end of the evening.</p>
        <p>Our favorite dishes were pretty much everything there -- the <strong>Chicken Fingers</strong> were incredible, the <strong>Applesauce Cake</strong> was divine, and the <strong>Broccoli, Lemon, &amp; Parmesan Soup</strong> was a surprising standout.</p>
        <p>The general opinion of A NEW WAY TO DINNER was that it's a good, but extremely frustrating cookbook. It inspired all of us to try something new -- but usually reaching for another cookbook to do so, or figuring out how to adapt their weekly meal plan to serve less, take out part of the week, or just make things a little more winter friendly. We were surprised by the amount of times a recipe required you to go back and make another recipe, or unapologeticly admitted halfway through that you just cooked about five times more than you needed in the first place, and we were all a little bit frustrated about how hard it was to find a certain dish in the messy layout. However, A NEW WAY TO DINNER taught us all a little something about meal planning, and I, for one, will ever be grateful that it made me learn to love a good chicken thigh.</p>
        <p>We also hosted our first ever cookbook swap, and hopefully some of you went home with some great new finds. If you'd like to try Curing &amp; Smoking your own meat -- I still have the book for that...</p>

          <p>We cook for our families everyday. Three times a day. Mostly alone, and mostly under stress. We try mountains of cookbooks to spice up the process, but really, we only cook a few recipes out of all of them. But what if we could try everything -- even the recipes we're afraid we can't master or the ones that have too many calories for us to eat?</p>
          <p>What if, instead of trying to enjoy these meals while our toddler screams and our spouse checks their iPhone, we could try all of these recipes with some good friends, relaxing conversation, and a perfect glass of wine?</p>
          <p>Yeah. We thought so.</p>
          <p>This club is going to be <strong>fun</strong>.</p>
          <p>Here is the article that inspired us to get off the internet and do something in the real world: <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/10/how-to-start-a-cookbook-club.html">"Why Cookbook Clubs Should Be The New Way We Entertain"</a>. Read it, and we think you'll agree.</p>
          <p>Here's how it will work: First we pick a date and a book, and then everyone who wants to come will send us an email about which recipe they would like to cook from that book. I will put a list of claimed recipes, along with any dietary restrictions, on this website.<p>
          <p>Now, just show up at the party with just that recipe -- don't bother to double it, don't worry too much about the temperature.</p>
          <p>Finally, we eat, we party, and then two months later, we'll do it all again.</p>

          <p>If you're reading this, you probably already know Ginny or Adriene.</p>
          <p>But if you don't, that's cool, too. The more people we have in our club, the more dishes we can taste.</p>
          <p>Drop us a line if you'd like to join!</p>
          <p>Or also if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>
