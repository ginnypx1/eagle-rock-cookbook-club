      <p>We cook for our families everyday. Three times a day. Mostly alone, and mostly under stress. We try mountains of cookbooks to spice up the process, but really, we only cook a few recipes out of all of them. But what if we could try everything -- even the recipes we're afraid we can't master or the ones that have too many calories for us to eat?</p>
      <p>What if, instead of trying to enjoy these meals while our toddler screams and our spouse checks their iPhone, we could try all of these recipes with some good friends, relaxing conversation, and a perfect glass of wine?</p>
      <p>Yeah. We thought so.</p>
      <p>This club is going to be <strong>fun</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here is the article that inspired us to get off the internet and do something in the real world: <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/10/how-to-start-a-cookbook-club.html">"Why Cookbook Clubs Should Be The New Way We Entertain"</a>. Read it, and we think you'll agree.</p>
      <p>Here's how it will work: First we pick a date and a book, and then everyone who wants to come will send us an email about which recipe they would like to cook from that book. I will put a list of claimed recipes, along with any dietary restrictions, on this website.<p>
      <p>Now, just show up at the party with just that recipe -- don't bother to double it, don't worry too much about the temperature.</p>
      <p>Finally, we eat, we party, and then two months later, we'll do it all again.</p>

      <h3 class="display-4">FAQs:</h3>
      <p><strong>Dietary restrictions: What does that mean?</strong> If you're a vegan, vegitarian, gluten-free or allergic to something like strawberries, we will make sure there will be enough dishes for you to taste to have fun. And then anyone who does want to bring a meat, strawberry, or gluten-full dish is free to cook and bring and share that, too.</p>
      <p><strong>Friends: Can I bring them?</strong> Sure! The more the merrier -- Spouse, best friend, co-worker, they're all welcome -- as long as they pick and cook a dish from the book.</p>
      <p><strong>Books: What if I don't already own them?</strong> Personally, we're always happy for the excuse to spoil ourselves and buy a new cookbook, but if you don't want to buy it, all three of these selections are available in the Pasadena Library system, and the LAPL has all but 'Near and Far' right now (but it probably will soon). Also, if you're my friend, just call me and you can come over and read my copy anytime.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is this still the Eagle Rock Cookbook Club if Ginny moved to Silver Lake?</strong> Hey, Adriene still lives in Eagle Rock! Besides, the Silver Lake and Eagle Rock Cookbook Club is just too complicated. But yes, we pretty much meet in Silver Lake now.</p>
