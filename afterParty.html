        <p>We had a fantastic time tasting many of the dishes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> on Sunday, January 15. Although we totally forgot to take pictures, the party was rocking, and despite the fact that every recipe in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> serves about 12 people, every single bit of food was gone by the end of the evening.</p>
        <p>Our favorite dishes were pretty much everything there -- the <strong>Chicken Fingers</strong> were incredible, the <strong>Applesauce Cake</strong> was divine, and the <strong>Broccoli, Lemon, &amp; Parmesan Soup</strong> was a surprising standout.</p>
        <p>The general opinion of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> was that it's a good, but extremely frustrating cookbook. It inspired all of us to try something new -- but usually reaching for another cookbook to do so, or figuring out how to adapt their weekly meal plan to serve less, take out part of the week, or just make things a little more winter friendly. We were surprised by the amount of times a recipe required you to go back and make another recipe, or unapologeticly admitted halfway through that you just cooked about five times more than you needed in the first place, and we were all a little bit frustrated about how hard it was to find a certain dish in the messy layout. However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> taught us all a little something about meal planning, and I, for one, will ever be grateful that it made me learn to love a good chicken thigh.</p>
        <p>We also hosted our first ever cookbook swap, and hopefully some of you went home with some great new finds. If you'd like to try Curing &amp; Smoking your own meat -- I still have the book for that...</p>
