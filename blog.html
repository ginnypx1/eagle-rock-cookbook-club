        <p>We had a fantastic time tasting many of the dishes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> on Sunday, January 15. Although we totally forgot to take pictures, the party was rocking, and despite the fact that every recipe in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> serves about 12 people, every single bit of food was gone by the end of the evening.</p>
        <p>Our favorite dishes were pretty much everything there -- the <strong>Chicken Fingers</strong> were incredible, the <strong>Applesauce Cake</strong> was divine, and the <strong>Broccoli, Lemon, &amp; Parmesan Soup</strong> was a surprising standout.</p>
        <p>The general opinion of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> was that it's a good, but extremely frustrating cookbook. It inspired all of us to try something new -- but usually reaching for another cookbook to do so, or figuring out how to adapt their weekly meal plan to serve less, take out part of the week, or just make things a little more winter friendly. We were surprised by the amount of times a recipe required you to go back and make another recipe, or unapologeticly admitted halfway through that you just cooked about five times more than you needed in the first place, and we were all a little bit frustrated about how hard it was to find a certain dish in the messy layout. However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480716198&sr=8-1&keywords=a+new+way+to+dinner+by+amanda+hesser+%26+merrill+stubbs">A NEW WAY TO DINNER</a> taught us all a little something about meal planning, and I, for one, will ever be grateful that it made me learn to love a good chicken thigh.</p>
        <p>We also hosted our first ever cookbook swap, and hopefully some of you went home with some great new finds. If you'd like to try Curing &amp; Smoking your own meat -- I still have the book for that...</p>

    <!-- story of the meeting -->
    <div class="container px-1">
      <p>Our third meeting was a fantastic sit-down under the stars. Despite heavy doubts by some members (OK, me), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-All-Easy-Delicious-Super-Busy/dp/1455584215/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463867335&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gwyneth+paltrow">"It's All Easy"</a> turned out to be a super userful and delicious cookbook, even though we all still find it hard to believe that Gwyneth Paltrow cooks and eats human food.</p>
      <p>We had a huge spread of amazing dishes. Everyone packed their plates and we squeezed in around one table for a long meal. We got to chat about everything we cooked and we gossiped and got to know each other much better. Julie passed around her (heavily annotated, well-used) copy of the cookbook and shared some of the recipes she tried out at home (pics below!). She also shared a great story about renaming the Singapore Rice Noodles "Angry Noodles." Apparently, and Melissa G. confirmed, Gwyneth wants you to put in a lot more ingredients that your wok can hold, and you just don't see that coming ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Despite Melissa B's obvious talents as a dessert chef -- her dog still raves about that Almond Cake -- the key lime tarts were living proof that you just can't trust a Hollywood Movie Star to make a good dessert. Oh, don't get me wrong, we still ate every bite. We also tried the hummingbird egg sized "chocolate truffles", but none of us understood why you would go to all that trouble when you could just buy a bar of dark chocolate and eat that instead.</p>
      <p>Our favorite dish of the evening was the <strong class="favorites">Spring Fattoush Salad</strong>. What a surprise! The <strong class="favorites">Beet Chips and Cilantro Hummus</strong> was a huge crowd-pleaser. Also, the <strong class="favorites">Lemongrass and Mint Tisane</strong> and the <strong class="favorites">Rosemary, Lemon and Chile Tisane</strong> were packed with flavor and were incredibly refreshing when served iced on a hot summer day.</p>
      <p>Dinner went over so well that we went through several bottles of wine, the night went late, and things got a little crazy. And isn't that what we all really wanted to happen?</p>
      <p>This meeting was an absolute blast and we can't wait to do it again!</p>

    <!-- story of the meeting -->
    <div class="container px-1">
      <p>Our second meeting was quite a bit different from the first. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Kitchen-Year-Recipes-Saved/dp/140006998X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458074593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=my+kitchen+year">"My Kitchen Year"</a> was a pretty great cookbook, and also a really, really thourough memoir of Ruth's life after 'Gourmet'. We agreed that the book was a little frustrating because Ruth assumes you all know certain temperatures foods cook at without being told and Ruth essentially has the palatte of a toddler -- she doesn't love vegetables, and she really doesn't love a lot of spices either. But one thing Ruth does love is dessert!</p>
      <p>Our favorite dish of the evening was totally the <strong class="favorites">Big New York Cheesecake</strong>. Melissa felt that the <strong class="favorites">Lemon Pudding Cake</strong> could have been a little less tart, Julie freeformed with adding mushroom, zucchini and onion to her <strong class="favorites">Custard in a Crust</strong>, and Ginny ate all the rest of the <strong class="favorites">Broccoli Rabe Bruschetta</strong> after everyone was gone.</p>
      <p>With such a small group, we really had a fantastic opportunity to taste and enjoy the food, and also to get to know each other. Ruth's roomie Carole King provided the tunes, and we also passed around a copy of Ruth's novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delicious-Novel-Ruth-Reichl/dp/0812982029/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458074632&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=delicious+ruth+reichl">Delicious</a>.</p>
      <p>We didn't take any pictures this time, but we're all looking forward to the next meeting!</p>
